\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{What did you learn about your data set?}


Scratch:

This analysis is complex because it is not clear which variable should be the response and which are the covariates.
For example, we can imagine a scenario where the increase of prices results in the increase of production, but it is also conceivable that the various levels of
production will drive prices changes.
