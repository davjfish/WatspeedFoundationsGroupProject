\section{Objectives}

\subsection{What are the goals of the analysis and why did you choose them?}

The goal of this analysis is to explore and better understand changes in the production of agricultural crops in Canada.
Understanding these fluctuations can yield valuable insights into the Canadian economy and the agricultural sector.

Statistics Canada collects copious amounts of data via the Census of Agriculture (REF) thus making these datasets excellent candidates for analysis in our group project.

\subsection{What question(s) do you want to answer?}

While the collections of elements affecting the total production of agricultural products are complex and multifaceted, this report we focus solely on a single variables: price.
