### Possible questions:
- Which products have shown the greatest change in price
- How does production of a given product correlate with price? For example, if we looked at egg production in response to prices https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/59a62325-9857-491e-8291-fe164c342e48/resource/e44d58af-e1fa-4719-966b-a69edcd4672d 


Loganberries, cranberries and blueberries, production and value

Another idea was to explore the impact of Canadian crop prices on crop production. We would tackle this question by exploring datasets released by StatsCan / Agricultural Census. 

This dataset provides a time series of agricultural product prices within Canada. We would try to establish a relationship between the price of a crop and its production over time. As an example, if we decide to explore this relationship with table egg production, here is a dataset looking at egg yields over time.

We can also explore rates of change in pricing for the different product types over time.
